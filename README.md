# Multi-Armed-Bandit-Problem

The Multi armed bandit problem is a class problem of reinforcement learning explaining the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Several Sampling methods have been made to get the maximum output. 
In this report, we investigate the Thompson Sampling and compare it with other sampling methods such as Random and Epsilon-Greedy using different samples.

This study highlights the importance of Statistical methods in policy advocacy for profit maximisation based on multi-choice problems.
